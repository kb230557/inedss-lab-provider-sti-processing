These scripts are designed to be used by local health department case investigators in Illinois. The scripts use the R Selenium package to mimic a case investigator moving case reports for chlamydia and gonorrhea from the I-NEDSS Lab Provider universe to the Cases universe. Before using these scripts, review the STI Processing Flow Chart and the Merge Comparison spreadsheet to understand how the script applies decision-making to each case. Note the branches on the flow chart that end in "Cancel" - these case reports will be left for a case investigator to manually review.
